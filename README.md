**Forecasting Household Electric Power Consumption**

**Dataset Information:**

1. Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
   
2. Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
   
3. Global_active_power: household global mi|nute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
   Global active power is a term used in electrical engineering to refer to the total active power consumption of a building    or an entire electrical grid. It measures the real power used by electrical devices and is expressed in watts (W).
  
4. Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
   Global reactive power is a term used in electrical engineering to refer to the total reactive power consumption of a  
   building or an entire electrical grid. It is a measure of the amount of electrical power that is flowing back and forth      between the source and the load in an alternating current (AC) electrical system, and it doesn't do any useful work, but     it is necessary to maintain the voltage level in the system. It is expressed in volt-amperes reactive (VAR).
   
5. Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volts)
   Voltage, also known as electric potential difference, is a measure of the electrical potential energy per unit charge in     an electrical circuit. It is the force that drives the flow of electric charge in a circuit and is expressed in volts (V).

6. Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
   Global intensity refers to the overall or average current flow in an electrical system or network, such as a building or     an entire electrical grid. It is a measure of the amount of electric charge moving through a conductor per unit of time       and is expressed in amperes (A).

7. Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy).
   It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but      gas-powered).

8. Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy).
   It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing machine, a tumble drier, a refrigerator and a light.

9. Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy).
   It corresponds to an electric water heater and an air-conditioner.
